Project Summary:

This project focuses on developing a decentralized computing network, drawing inspiration from the Tor internet privacy model. The system replicates base files across the network to ensure data availability and durability. By leveraging distributed resources such as CPU, networking, and memory, the project aims to provide community members with greater access to computational power than what's available to them individually.

The system employs encrypted communications to maintain privacy and security. By using an onion model, it adds layers of protection to sensitive data and computations, ensuring that users' private information remains confidential. This innovative approach allows the network to offer enhanced access to resources while safeguarding individual privacy.
